# Image Processing API

This project aims to give you a real-world scenario in which you would read and write to your disk via a Node.js express
server rather than a database. The project you create serves two purposes: to prepare you for setting up scalable code
and architecture for real-world projects and tie together some of the most popular middleware and utilities found in
Node.js projects. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible but will prove your ability to use what
youâ€™ve learned in real-world scenarios.

For this project, refactor and test as much as possible while you are building. Since you are using TypeScript and an
unfamiliar library, it is sometimes easier to write and build in plain JS to see what your functions return; remember
your submission needs to be in TypeScript. As your skills improve, typing in TypeScript will feel more intuitive. Make
sure to remove any debugging code from your final submission.

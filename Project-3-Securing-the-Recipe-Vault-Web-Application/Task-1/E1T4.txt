Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
The Security Group-WebAppSG is allows ingress traffic from the internet to multiple ports which is exposing the server to attacks and allow those egress traffic to any IP address.
We only need to allow port 5000 from the Security Group to ALB and remove all traffic rule.

# Poor practice 2
The InstanceRolePolicy-C3 IAM Role has full access to any S3 bucket instance, this is not least privileged. 
We only need to allow 'GetObject' permission to InstanceRole because the web service instance only need to read recipes.
